# Cyber Metrics
Quantifying cyber risk is one of the biggest challenges in info sec today. Since the advent of the Orange book, people have been trying to quantify security or measure it in some form. Does the phrase "less" or "more secure" have any inference ? Though security may never be directly measured, can there be some metrics for it. There are various frameworks, and organizations such as PCI-DSS  NIST standards, BSIMM which focuses on software security. 

This endeavour of cyber metrics done by the research team at NYU asks the question whether a reliable metrics of cyber metrics can be formed by asking the gut feeling of cybersecurity experts.

NYU's cyber metrics index of expert opinion or "gut feeling" on status of cyber security has been collecting opinion data over the last 8 years. This is an attempt to parse through and analyze the data with the ELK stack and conclude whether any corelations can be drawn between "gut feeling of experts" and "the actual state of cyber security".
